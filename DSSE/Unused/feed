In the model building process, we prioritize interpretable models whose training and performance yield insights about the underlying process, along with optimizing the selected objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our technologies of choice are Python in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend, and our tech stack includes Django, MySQL, Redshift, S3, DynamoDB, and Elasticsearch storage, asynchronous tasks over RabbitMQ, and distributed data processing over Elastic MapReduce and Spark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU&amp;rsquo;LL DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build ML products that leverage Simon&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary data access to drive real business value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build high-quality statistical models by executing the entire model-building process, including data cleaning, feature extraction, model selection, and predictive validation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the tooling and interfaces used to support the data science process at Simon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Represent Simon DS in conversations with stakeholders at our client companies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advance Simon as a thought leader in data science, by writing blog posts and papers, and presenting at industry conferences&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guide internal product and technology strategy by representing data science perspectives and requirements in conversations with your peers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ph.D. in Statistics/Machine Learning, or equivalent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication of statistical concepts to expert &amp;amp; non-expert audiences&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broad and up-to-date knowledge of machine learning models (and their performance characteristics) for classification and regression tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specific experience designing and building machine-learning models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluency in at least one statistical coding environment (numpy/pandas, R, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfort coding in at least one non-statistical language (e.g. Python or Java, not R or Matlab)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluency in SQL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Production-level software engineering experience is a plus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expertise in causal inference, experiment design, reinforcement learning, and related fields is a plus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visa sponsorship for this role is currently not available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re proud to be an equal opportunity employer open to all qualified applicants regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or expression, Veteran status, or any other legally protected status.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2019 20:09:19 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2019-09-11T20:09:19Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">New York, NY</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">294783</guid><link>https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/294783/data-scientist-remote-united-states-crisp?a=1ARnYqnxarOo&amp;so_medium=Talent&amp;so_source=TalentApi</link><a10:author><a10:name>Crisp</a10:name></a10:author><category>data-science</category><category>time-series</category><category>forecasting</category><title>Data Scientist - [Remote] - [United States] at Crisp () (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Here at Crisp, we value the strength in teamwork, and strongly believe that it&amp;rsquo;s the key to Crisp&amp;rsquo;s success.

You know both the art&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;science of analytics - not only do you know how to find answers in the data, you also know which questions should be asked in the first place and what data can help us further bolster our conclusions.&amp;nbsp;You love engaging with customers, learning about their challenges and then diving into the data to see how to solve them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs of a great candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You know that your team members&amp;rsquo; perspectives will make your solutions better.

When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciative of honest feedback.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work smarter and harder.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical and practical mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises.

This involves deploying near real-time machine learning models at massive scale to some of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest organisations. Our mission is to keep the world&amp;rsquo;s most sensitive data private and secure - to do this we're looking for data scientists who pride themselves on their ability to learn new skills, are comfortable with the unknown, and are willing to experiment. Companies can leverage data science in a number of ways, and we think the role of a Data Scientist falls into three distinct categories: 1) You work for a business function analysing &amp;amp; reporting on how to improve a key metric, e.g increasing user conversion 2) You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;3) The product that the company sells is the machine learning models you build&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Tessian couldn't exist without our machine learning models; it&amp;rsquo;s at the heart of what we do, and it&amp;rsquo;s what our clients rely on day-to-day. We're looking for data scientists who are excited about the opportunities and challenges that come with researching, building and deploying real-time production models. We're looking for applicants with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;5+ year's production experience&lt;/strong&gt;, or you've completed a machine learning/statistics/physics PhD and want to become more applied. You should have experience owning complex projects from start to finish and an interest in eventually leading a team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;More junior than this?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jobs.lever.co/tessian/50ecfd39-f5a9-4014-8d73-00754934656e" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out our non-senior role variant here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Our team has come together from a diverse set of academic and professional backgrounds: software development, computer science, mathematics, physics, and metallurgy. Our goal is to leverage this expertise through trust and cooperation. We want to foster an environment where team members have frequent opportunities to learn from each other in fields that they are not (yet) experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine learning and data science we employ comes in several varieties: image processing, signal processing, classical supervised modeling, unsupervised methods, and fundamental statistics and probability. As a machine learning engineer, your specific expertise as well as your motivation would be the major factors in determining your day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are grateful to stand on the shoulders of the open source giants. We use NumPy-flavored Python3 as the basis for our development, taking advantage of the availability of libraries designed for both software engineering and data science, ranging from Flask to SciPy, SQLAlchemy to Keras, Jupyter to Pandas, and many more. When Python&amp;rsquo;s time or space complexity becomes a constraint, we turn to modern C++.

Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases and ASP.net web applications, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 200 nodes with multiple clusters and .net APIs and react.js/Angular 1&amp;amp;2 web products plugging in.

Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available&amp;mdash;giving our users time for what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn&amp;rsquo;t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you&amp;rsquo;ll work with freezer cooking, &amp;ldquo;cooking math,&amp;rdquo; user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; - It isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in the Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt; - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software&amp;rsquo;s main functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Love for Math&lt;/strong&gt; - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn&amp;rsquo;t the role for you. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Leadership&lt;/strong&gt; - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience Working on a LIVE Product&lt;/strong&gt; - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative.

Or &amp;ldquo;thanks, that new system you put in place lets us easily try different mathematical models which we thought were too difficult to experiment with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously finding this blend of serious technical skills and personality is not easy, but we are willing to work to find you, the perfect candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also added some perks to sweeten the deal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast and lunch cooked in house every day by a team of chefs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear whatever you want to work (there are no customers, remember?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular team events that are actually fun (for example: beer brewing, wine tasting lessons, ping pong tournaments, soccer teams, fancy dinners)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best health insurance plans you can get in NYC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very small company with a flat organizational structure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech-oriented leadership - all of our Partners are programmers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost no multithreaded programming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the biggest monitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk technical details. We are a linux/unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that&amp;rsquo;s probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java. In fact, our programming test requires either C, C++ or Java although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t focus on language features. We are also looking for someone with web/UI skills to join the team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leo came to HRT immediately after graduating from the Cornell CS department. He enjoyed the low-level details of Operating Systems as well as the theory of Algorithms and was open to learning new technologies and languages on the fly. He had an affinity for building fast, efficient, and scalable systems and tinkered with C++ and Rust in his own time. In group projects, peers at school would single him out for his technical strength, work ethic, and positive attitude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;When he&amp;rsquo;s not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David&amp;rsquo;s writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like &amp;ldquo;one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays&amp;rdquo;. He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kai came to HRT after 3.5 years of programming C++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. He plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. He builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. He is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates&amp;rsquo; happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. He's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. He enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on what it&amp;rsquo;s like to work at HRT, see:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-at-Hudson-River-Trading" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-at-Hudson-River-Trading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 14:36:05 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2019-09-13T14:36:05Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">New York, NY</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">284843</guid><link>https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/284843/data-management-engineer-amazon?a=1xwHJTKYnNvO&amp;so_medium=Talent&amp;so_source=TalentApi</link><a10:author><a10:name>Amazon</a10:name></a10:author><category>hadoop</category><category>sql</category><category>security</category><title>Data Management Engineer at Amazon (Santa Monica, CA)</title><description>Ring is looking for a Software Development Engineer who will help us create the next generation of apps, and services.

Therefore the team will focus on three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous experience&lt;/strong&gt;: This includes a rider app, in-vehicle experience (e.g. ride-simulation on a tablet), a safety driver app (yes, we still need humans for a few more years) and features for autonomous vehicle interaction (e.g. car body functions)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shuttle functionality&lt;/strong&gt;: We believe autonomous vehicles should be shared as a default. As we have full control over the car we focus, beside a great user journey, on optimising pickup rate and pooling algorithms in close collaboration with our Data Science team&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routing and Mapping&lt;/strong&gt;: A human driver has a lot of knowledge around the street conditions. We need to simulate this for our future Robo-Taxi and we will build our own mapping and routing capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear. You will build something no one has built before. Therefore we will take fast decisions, change the path where necessary and expect own ideas and impulses from every engineer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our technology stack is mainly based on Kotlin and Java (but we firmly believe that every language is beautiful), our microservices are running on AWS, we are a big fan of Docker and we monitor everything with our ELK infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, if you&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;...love an agile and fast-paced environment&lt;br&gt;...like to write (good and clean) code&lt;br&gt;...have your own ideas on how to influence the product&lt;br&gt;...want to challenge yourself and learn new stuff every day&lt;br&gt;...make a difference&lt;br&gt;it definitely makes sense for you to apply now. We are happy to challenge you the following way:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiting Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We believe finding the right people is the core of success. It should be challenging as well as fun and give you a transparent picture what you can expect from your new role. During the process we focus on three core areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tech Excellence: Meet our amazing engineers, present them your thoughts and discuss different technical solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motivation: Have a great conversation with our leadership team and convince them about the why behind your application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teamfit: This is the best part of the process. You will have the chance to meet your future colleagues. If you are in Europe we will organize a meeting in person, otherwise a virtual one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we will offer you a job with one of the most exciting teams you could imagine + some great benefits!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we offer you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benefits benefits = Benefits.builder()&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;.setFurtherTraining(WORKSHOPS, CREATIVE_DAYS, LANGUAGE_COURSES)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;.setMonetaryBenefits(&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; PENSION_PLAN,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; FREE_TAXI_RIDES,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_TICKET,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; URBAN_SPORTS_CLUB)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;.setFoodAndDrinks(&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; FRUIT_BASKET,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; FREE_BEER,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; SOFT_DRINKS)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;.setEvents(MONTHLY_AFTER_WORK, OFF_SITE, TEAM_EVENTS, BBQ)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;.build();&lt;br&gt;jobOffer.addBenefits(benefits);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and the opportunity to work with the best team in the world (we know, everybody says so, but at FREE NOW it&amp;rsquo;s true)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now you made it - you are already part of the top 10% who read the whole job description - use the codeword &amp;ldquo;flying unicorn&amp;rdquo; to prove our recruiting team that you are truly interested ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2019 14:54:11 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2019-09-28T14:54:11Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Berlin, Germany</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">199873</guid><link>https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/199873/backend-engineer-wildlife?a=151VX4yPklfW&amp;so_medium=Talent&amp;so_source=TalentApi</link><a10:author><a10:name>Wildlife</a10:name></a10:author><category>go</category><category>kubernetes</category><category>postgresql</category><category>node.js</category><category>apache-kafka</category><title>Backend Engineer at Wildlife (State of São Paulo, Brazil)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adtech backend engineers are responsible for defining the architecture and implementing systems with high availability and scalability which interact with different ad networks and are essential to distribute our games.
